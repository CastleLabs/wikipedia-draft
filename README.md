## History

The Castle Fun Center began operating in the early 1990s as an outdoor miniature golf facility and expanded over time to add an indoor complex for year-round use, along with additional outdoor rides and recreation areas.<ref name="About">{{cite web |title=Park Information |url=https://thecastlefuncenter.com/park-information/ |website=The Castle Fun Center |access-date=2025-08-15}}</ref> 

In July 2016, local newspaper ''The Photo News'' reported a round of expansions that added several outdoor attractions, including a classic 32-seat swing ride, a Midi Dance Party 360 pendulum thrill ride branded “Dragon Frenzy 360,” and Spin Zone bumper cars.<ref name="PhotoNews2016">{{cite news |title=The Castle Fun Center expands again |url=https://www.thephoto-news.com/news/local-news/the-castle-fun-center-expands-again-CAPN20160707160709962 |work=The Photo News |date=2016-07-07 |access-date=2025-08-15}}</ref>

In December 2017, Spectrum News 1 reported that The Castle Fun Center was among Mid-Hudson Valley businesses receiving funding through New York State’s Regional Economic Development Council program, noting a $500,000 grant tied to tourism and indoor expansion plans.<ref name="SpectrumGrant">{{cite news |last=Givens |first=Orie |title=Chester business gets regional economic development grant |url=https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/hudson-valley/news/2017/12/14/chester-business-gets-regional-economic-development-grant |work=Spectrum News 1 Hudson Valley |date=2017-12-13 |access-date=2025-08-15}}</ref>

## Layout and theming

The attraction is divided into two main zones: a climate-controlled indoor complex and an outdoor midway that operates seasonally. The indoor area includes bowling (Jester’s Lanes), laser tag, roller skating, Ballocity, axe throwing, an arcade, a rock wall, the InflataPark, party rooms, and dining spaces. The outdoor area features multiple go-kart tracks, two 18-hole miniature golf courses, and several family rides such as a swing ride, drop tower, zip line, and a family coaster. The complex uses a light “castle” motif in branding and décor.<ref name="officialsite" /><ref name="About" />
