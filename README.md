## History

The Castle Fun Center began operating in the early 1990s as a small outdoor miniature golf center.<ref name="about">{{cite web |title=Park Information |url=https://thecastlefuncenter.com/park-information/ |website=The Castle Fun Center |access-date=2025-08-15}}</ref> Over the years, it expanded significantly, adding an indoor arcade, roller skating rink, and party rooms to allow year-round operations. 

By the late 1990s and early 2000s, outdoor attractions including go-kart tracks, batting cages, and premium rides were introduced. The facility continued to add modern attractions through the 2010s, including laser tag, a climbing wall, and upgraded bowling lanes. In 2019, The Castle unveiled a large inflatable attraction area to meet growing demand for active play experiences.

A major milestone came in 2025 with the debut of the **Elevated Road Course** — a three-story go-kart track featuring banked curves, spiral ascents, and descents, which replaced and upgraded the main outdoor track.<ref name="gokarts">{{cite web |title=Go Karts |url=https://thecastlefuncenter.com/attractions/go-karts/ |website=The Castle Fun Center |access-date=2025-08-15}}</ref> The addition further established the venue as a competitive entertainment option in the region.
